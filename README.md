CKEditor 4
==========
This is the Texas Tribune's test version of CKEditor used for a minimalist editor
within the Django Admin.

We'll be giving it a test drive on our flat pages.

It includes a custom TT plugin for auto-linking politicians to their directory pages.

## Documentation

Our CKeditor wiki is available at: https://wiki.texastribune.org/x/OI0c.

The full editor documentation is available online at the following address:

## Installation

Rather than overriding widget behavior in Django, we're keeping this as js loaded
where needed. To install, place the appropriate scripts in a template.
